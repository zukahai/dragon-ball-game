      We're already so familiar with the Dragon Ball series, so I won't explain further. Since I was a kid, I've been a big fan of this show.

      I'm not very fond of playing games myself, but I really enjoy creating games for others to play. Therefore, in my free time, I decided to learn WebGL with Pixi.js in JavaScript and challenge myself by working on this game.

    However, because I was learning and researching Pixi.js at the same time, I haven't optimized this game well. (Now I have more experience, and I've switched to working on another game project, so I'm not using this project anymore). If you're passionate, you can take it and research to optimize it further.

    Here's a little secret: Currently, I'm working on a new project, so this game I'm sharing needs a lot of optimization, from images, scene transitions, to slowing down when moving the map, background, and some physics effects. Additionally, I need to add more animations to make the game even smoother.

    Note: You're reading the readme for the client-side of the game. (Scroll down to section 4 to get the link to the server file.)

3. Created 
    - The game has been written on JavaScript source code.
    - The library used is Pixijs v7.0

4. Install

    -  Youcan run the client via **Visual Code** **live Server** (I used it while writing this game)
    -  Open the **config.json** file and edit the **server** line to your IP if you want to configure it online (I have 127.0.0.1 preconfigured to run on localhost).
    - After the installation is complete you can enter the game to experience.
5. Note
    - This is the client, you need to add the file server.
    - download the file server: https://github.com/int04/dragon-ball-h5-MMO-Server
